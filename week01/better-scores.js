# Exercise Basic-1: Better Scores
_Goal: basic handling of JavaScript arrays_

Develop a small JavaScript program to manage the scores given to your user on website . Scores are integer numbers, and they may be negative. You should:
 
- Define an array with all the scores you received in chronological order. For simplicity:
  - Embed the scores directly in the source code.
- Duplicate the array, but:
  - Eliminate all negative scores (call \`NN\` the number of negative scores that are deleted).
  - Eliminate the two lowest-ranking scores.
  - Add `NN+2` new scores, at the end of the array, with a value equal to the (rounded) average of the existing scores.
- Print both arrays, comparing the scores before and after the "improvement," and showing the averages in both cases.

    newscores.push(value)
